Task : To analyse the difference in usage of bikes between annual members and casual users.
Data : We were given data of the last 12 months of the bike usage which contained over 6 million rows.
Analysis : After cleaning and transforming the data, I calculated the average time spent by the different types of members by day.
Insights :  Although we had more annual members using the bikes, the casual members used the bikes for longer. The data shows that the casual members use the bikes way longer than the annual members and that is shown in the visuals attached in this repository.
